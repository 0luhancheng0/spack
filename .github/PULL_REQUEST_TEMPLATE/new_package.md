<!-- Thanks for taking the time to add a package to Spack! To proceed, please:

1. If the PR includes a single package, title the PR "<name-of-the-package>: new-package".
   If the PR includes a package and dependencies, title the PR "<name-of-the-package> and dependencies: new-package".
   If the PR includes mulitple unrelated packages, title the PR "<name-of-package-1>, <name-of-package-2>[, <names-of-additional-packages>]: new-packages

2. Provide at least one operating system and architecture combination for which you have built the package in testing.
   Please list additional combinations if you tested more extensively. There is no need to do additional testing for this step.

   e.g. "tested on centos7/x86_64" or
        "builds on centos7/x86_64, rhel8/aarch64, ..."

3. If you wish to be involved in the discussion of future changes to this package, consider adding yourself as a maintainer of this package by putting `maintainers = ['<your-github-username>']` in the package class.

Thank you again for the contribution! -->
